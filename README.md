# baseSteam for Minecraft 1.13.2

baseSteam continues DrCyano's Steam Advantage, adding boilers, pipework, storage and steam-powered machines to basePower.

Use basePower `2.4.5.113021` and Base Metals `3.0.2.113021` for Forge 1.13.2. baseSteam's machines and parts are on the shared **basePower** creative tab. Back up the world and config, then replace the old jars together and test on a copy. Save, close Minecraft completely, and reopen the copy to check your machines.

The recipe book unlocks steam recipes when you pick up the ingredients. See the [material checklist](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/basePower/blob/master-1.13.2/docs/1.13/RECIPE-DISCOVERY.md). Crushing is a machine recipe, so it doesn't appear in the crafting book. After changing recipes, run `node tools/generate-recipe-unlocks.js` and `check`.

The [manufacturing progression audit](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/PowerAdvantage/blob/master-1.13.2/docs/1.13/MANUFACTURING-PROGRESSION.md) checks raw-material, processing and loot acquisition paths in every mode, including restart persistence.

## Building Minecraft 1.13.2

The `master-1.13.2` build uses ForgeGradle 7.0.34 and Gradle 9.6.1. Run Gradle with Java 17; production code is compiled for Java 8.

Build the pinned basePower, Base Metals and OreSpawn development jars first. The source commits and checksums in `gradle.properties` keep local and CI builds on the same inputs.
With the standard sibling layout:

```text
cd ..\..\PowerAdvantage
gradlew.bat deobfJar
```

Then build SteamAdvantage:

```text
gradlew.bat clean check build javadoc verifyReleaseDependencies verifyReleaseArtifacts writeReleaseChecksums verifyEclipseProductionClasspath
```

Alternative layouts may pass `-PpowerAdvantageDeobfJar=<path>`, `-PbaseMetalsDeobfJar=<path>`, and `-PoreSpawnDeobfJar=<path>`. None of those dependencies is embedded.

For publishing, use the [MMD release workflow](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/baseSteam/actions/workflows/deploy-release.yml). It publishes the same checked jar to CurseForge and MMD Maven.

For Eclipse, import this repository as an existing Gradle project and run:

```text
gradlew.bat cleanEclipse verifyEclipseProductionClasspath
```

Refresh the project in Eclipse, allow its Java build to finish, and launch the generated `runClient.launch`. Eclipse launches discover SteamAdvantage from `bin/main`; command-line Gradle launches use `build/forge-run-mod-classes/main`. The Eclipse audit checks that discovery points at the same production output Eclipse compiles into.

The Eclipse resource root is `build/resources/main`, so its builder copies expanded mod metadata rather than raw source templates. Refresh the Gradle project and clean/rebuild after this setup changes. After resource/version edits, run `processResources` or refresh Gradle before launching; do not put `src/main/resources` back on the Eclipse Java build path.

## Compatibility

The [stronger regression-test backport](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/PowerAdvantage/blob/master-1.13.2/docs/1.13/TEST-COVERAGE-BACKPORT.md)
records measured machine work, restart checks, repaired windows and remaining limits.

For an all-Advantage play-test, run `prepareCombinedEclipseLaunch` in the sibling PowerAdvantage checkout and select its `runClientAllAdvantage.launch`. The [native resource probe](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/PowerAdvantage/blob/master-1.13.2/test-rig/client-resources/README.md) checks models, textures and names across all three mods. These resource checks do not replace gameplay testing.

The implementation namespace is `zone.moddev.mc.basesteam`. Steam registers its legacy block and tile mappings with basePower so old Steam Advantage and baseSteam worlds can be converted before Minecraft flattens the saved block states. Boiler heat, tanks, inventories and drill state are carried over rather than reinitialised.

Read PowerAdvantage's [1.13 migration guide](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/PowerAdvantage/blob/master-1.13.2/docs/1.13/MIGRATION.md) before upgrading, and always use a backup. The [qualification notes](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/PowerAdvantage/blob/master-1.13.2/docs/1.13/CURRENT-QUALIFICATION.md) list the tested scenarios and remaining gaps.

## Generator Follow-Up

The [generator follow-up](../../PowerAdvantage/docs/1.13/TEST-COVERAGE-BACKPORT.md#generator-follow-up) records the older `pa113-candidate-g` inputs.
Its 126 operating jobs and 126 cold checks, 39 GUI windows, 351 caption cases,
355 rejected broken controls, eight frozen routes, five connected routes and
paired 30-minute runs passed. This is a pre-final Steam-control checkpoint,
not qualification of the newer SteamAdvantage jars or harness. Those still need
the final sweep. Manual play-testing and release review remain separate.

## Final T Candidate

The [final-t checkpoint](../../PowerAdvantage/docs/1.13/TEST-COVERAGE-BACKPORT.md#final-t-candidate)
records profile `pa113-candidate-i` and its exact jar hashes. All 132 operating
jobs and 132 cold-restart comparisons pass, including an independent audit of
six Steam controls and their nine tile-hold records. GUI checks pass for 39
windows, 351 caption cases and 355 rejected broken controls.
Frozen migration passed on 8 routes and connected-source operation passed on
all five declared routes.
Fresh and migrated-copy 30-minute runs pass. Power and Electric retain their
exact-hash release and reproducibility proof; final-t Steam passes its full suite
and two independent export builds. All 18 mod/version release and reproducibility
gates pass across the six maintained Minecraft lines. Both requested broad
profiles and their independent audit pass; the reporter-only unit/replay
qualification preserves the original native proof. Survival harvest checks pass
before and after restart. The report's extra network/drill scopes are now
qualified; manual acceptance remains separate. Earlier checkpoints keep their original scope;
nothing has been published by this local test work.
